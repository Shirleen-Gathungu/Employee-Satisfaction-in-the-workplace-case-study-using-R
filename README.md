## Factors Influencing Satisfaction
### Departmental Differences
Compared job satisfaction levels across different departments (employee_department). Are there any departments with notably higher or lower satisfaction levels? Are there differences in average hours worked or number of projects across departments?

### Salary and Satisfaction
Investigated the relationship between salary levels (salary_level) and job satisfaction. Do employees with higher salaries tend to report higher satisfaction levels?

### Work-Life Balance
Analyzed the relationship between average monthly hours worked (average_monthly_hours) and job satisfaction. Do employees who work longer hours tend to report lower satisfaction levels?

### Promotion and Satisfaction
Examined whether employees who received promotions in the last 5 years (promotion_last_5years) have higher job satisfaction compared to those who did not receive promotions.

### Tenure and Satisfaction
Explored how job satisfaction levels vary with employees' tenure (employee_tenure). Do longer-tenured employees tend to be more satisfied with their jobs?

### Work Accidents and Satisfaction
Investigated whether employees who have experienced work accidents (work_accidents) report lower job satisfaction compared to those who have not.

### Performance Evaluation and Satisfaction
Analyzed the relationship between employees' most recent performance evaluation scores (last_evaluation) and job satisfaction. Do employees with higher performance ratings tend to report higher satisfaction levels?
